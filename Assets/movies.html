        <h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-Time</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Shaun of the Dead</h3>
        <p>This is my favorite comedy and horror movie all in one.  It also taught me alot about the style repetition in movies.</p>
        <h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
        <p>"Funny thing on the out side I was straight as an arrow.  I had to come to prison to be a crook" - Andy Duframe</p>
        <h3>Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</h3>
        <p>I feel like this is the first time that Hollywood got this genre right.  They didn't mess it up and they didn't make it super cheesy.</p>
